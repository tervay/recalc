      <h3 className="title is-3">How accurate are the calculators?</h3>
      <p>
        The math behind them is sound &ldquo;in theory,&rdquo; but of course,
        everything works in theory. There are lots of variables that go into a
        robot, and the results of the calculator may not be perfect. If you
        believe there to be any error in the calculators (major or minor),
        please feel free to{" "}

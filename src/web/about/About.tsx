          <h3 className="title is-3">How accurate are the calculators?</h3>
          <p>
            The math behind them is sound &ldquo;in theory,&rdquo; but of
            course, everything works in theory. There are lots of variables that
            go into a robot, and the results of the calculator may not be
            perfect. If you believe there to be any error in the calculators
            (major or minor), please feel free to{" "}
